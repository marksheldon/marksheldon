- Hi, Iâ€™m @marksheldon
- I'm a teaching professor at Tufts University
- Iâ€™m interested in programming languages, concurrent and distributed computing
- Iâ€™ve been using Erlang in my concurrent programming course for a while, and I would like to learn more
about it, specifically how to think about and structure projects.
- I'm also interested in Buddhism
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... some open source Erlang projects
